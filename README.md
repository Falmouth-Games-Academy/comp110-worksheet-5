(a)	Finds duplicates within a list.
(b)	Checks itself (n), then checks itself again (n * n  n^2).
(c)	The algorithm still checks every number against every element behind it. 
(d)	The first algorithm checks every element twice, whereas the second algorithm that checks each element behind itself, only checks each element once.
(e)	Yes, because for every element checked in the list, every other element is compared, meaning O(n^2)
(f)	O(n log n)
(g)	O(log n)
(h)	Algorithm 2, as it takes half the amount of time., and doesn’t check each element many times.
(i) In a list less than 100 elements, the "slower" algorithm actually completes faster.
