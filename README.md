Base repository for COMP110 worksheet 5

### A)

The procedure checks for elements equal to each other, where the indexes are not equal (progressive 2 dimensional iteration).

### B)

Checking `list` at indexes `i` & `j` where not equal, requires dual integer decrementation. On each cycle, checking for a return condition or if a loop condition has been met. `n^2` is the count of values to check.

(TODO:)

### C)

`j` now only checks from where `i` is currently at, therefore requiring less checks each cycle.

(TODO:)

### D)

Checking each index from where `i` left off, reducing the time to complete the task (progressive decremation sequence over list of values).

(TODO:)

### E)

Yes, it is still possible to search the entire list (yet it does not reveal what value(s) it has found, so there can be more than one duplicate).

(TODO:)

### F)
