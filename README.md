a - Checks if a list has 2 or more of the same items inside it.

b - Because it would take a lot longer to calculate.

c - Because j only ever needs to check the numbers i has been through.

d - Because j doesn't need to go through the whole list every time.

e - No, it is now linear. As performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input.

f - According to "https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity" Python's sort function is O(n log n) in big-O notation.

g - O(n log n) seeing as it is using the sort function.

h - Then 2nd algorithm would run faster as it doesn't need to loop as much thanks to the sorting function.

i - If the list is already sorted than the "slower" algorithm will act faster as it can skip the sorting stage.
