a) The algorithm looks for the same numbers from the list, but it must not be the same position.
if it finds similar numbers, it returns true. Otherwise, returns that it didn't find anything.

b) Because it checks the same numbers twice.

c & d) It still runs correct, but it won't go over the same checks every time the first loop "i" increases.

e) No, it's not. In this case, the algorithm doesn't check the same numbers twice.

f) https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-time-complexity-of-the-Python-built-in-sorted-function. Time complexity of Python's *sort* is O(n log n)

g) The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), because it checks with the numbers that are next to each other, unlike the first one.

h) With a binary search the algorithm only looks for halfs of the remaining list, whereas linear is checkinh every single one, which take more time.

i) It might be more precise than the faster one.
