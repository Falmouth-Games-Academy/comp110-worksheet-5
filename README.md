(a)go through two lists then see if the list are different sizes but have the same final number

(b)N has to go through two loops which causes it to have an O(n^2)

(c)changing line 4 will always make the first condition true and dosn't make the second condition false

(d)N only has to go through one loop

(e) no as i said above N only has to go through one loop

(f) Worst case performance  O(nlogn) Best case performance   O(n) 
Average case performance    O(nlogn) Worst case space complexity O(n)

(g) O(n) as it has a sort function

(h) the algothem that starts after question e as O(log n) is quicker then O(n^2)

(j) the slower algorithm might use less resorces or have another advantage.
