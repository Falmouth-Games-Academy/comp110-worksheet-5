Base repository for COMP110 worksheet C


a) The algo is describing a list comparison/duplication checking (if used in game development: possible collision avoidance--)

b) The algo is moving over the list for each list item (If the algo does "n" things and each "thing is O(n) then the overall algo is O(n^2)

c) 

d) Because it is only checking the positions before the i (each iteration), not the whole list.

e) still quadratic?? (But I did lean to O(log n))

f) Python sort = O (n log n) https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/ICS-33/lectures/complexitypython.txt

g) linear search (worksheet algo = O (n log n) 

h) the second algo would run faster 

i) If the the list is very small (few elements in the list, complexity is not an issue)
