### A)

Where variable `list` is of type `T[]` and type `T` is defined on input, check for duplicate values at each index **in reverse** (progressive 2 dimensional iteration).

(TODO:)

### B)

As variable `j` is iterated through to 0, `i` is decremented by 1. And repeat until `i` reaches 0 or until return is called. The worst case is defined as having duplicate values on the last 2 indexes (therefore resulting in the longest possible runtime).
