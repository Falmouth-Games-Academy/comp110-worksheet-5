###a)  
The algorithm takes a list and iterates through it comparing different items in the list checking for duplicates.  
If there are two items which are the same at different indices then there is a duplicate so the program returns 'true'.  
If there are no duplicates the program returns 'false'.  

###b)  
There are 2 nested for loops. The outer loop executes n times and the inner loop executes m times for each n.  
Therefore the time complexity is n * m or O($n^2$).
