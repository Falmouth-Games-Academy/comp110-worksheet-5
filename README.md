## (a)
This algorithm will check every index in i and j against each other, if they are the same then it will return true therefore revealing that there is a duplicate in one of the lists.

## (b)
the worst case scenario for this algorithm is if there is no duplicates in the lists, this is because it would have to run through both lists completely. Alone these searches would be O(n), however, when there are no duplicates then it would end up being O(n²). It ends up being quadratic because the two linear algorithms would be multiplyed together, which can then be simplified to O(n²).

## (c)
